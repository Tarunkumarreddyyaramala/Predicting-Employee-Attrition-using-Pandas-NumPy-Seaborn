# Predicting Employee Attrition using Pandas, NumPy & Seaborn

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform **Employee Attrition Analysis** using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** on a real-world HR dataset.  
The goal is to understand the dataset, clean it, visualize important patterns, and extract useful insights to help organizations reduce attrition and improve employee retention.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File:** `HR_Employee_Attrition.csv`  
- **Description:** The dataset contains employee-related information such as:
  - `Age` – Age of the employee  
  - `BusinessTravel` – Frequency of business travel  
  - `Department` – Employee’s department  
  - `DistanceFromHome` – Distance from home to office  
  - `Education` – Education level of the employee  
  - `EnvironmentSatisfaction` – Work environment satisfaction rating  
  - `Gender` – Gender of the employee  
  - `JobRole` – Job role of the employee  
  - `JobSatisfaction` – Job satisfaction level  
  - `MaritalStatus` – Marital status of the employee  
  - `MonthlyIncome` – Monthly income of the employee  
  - `OverTime` – Whether the employee works overtime (Yes/No)  
  - `PercentSalaryHike` – Percentage salary increase  
  - `TotalWorkingYears` – Total years of work experience  
  - `TrainingTimesLastYear` – Number of training sessions attended  
  - `WorkLifeBalance` – Work-life balance rating  
  - `YearsAtCompany` – Total years spent in the company  
  - `Attrition` – Employee attrition status (Target variable)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## 📊 Project Workflow  

### 1. Import Libraries  
Load necessary Python libraries for data analysis.  

### 2. Data Understanding  
- Load dataset  
- Check shape, data types, null values  
- Summary statistics  

### 3. Data Preparation  
- Drop irrelevant columns  
- Select important features  
- Handle missing values  
- Detect and remove duplicates  

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Univariate analysis (distribution of features like Age, Education, Satisfaction)  
- Bivariate analysis (Attrition vs. Overtime, JobRole, MonthlyIncome, etc.)  
- Pairplots, scatterplots, histograms  
- Correlation matrix & heatmap  

### 5. Visualization  
- Attrition distribution by categorical features (Department, Gender, Overtime)  
- Relationship between age, income, and attrition  
- Correlation heatmap of numerical variables  

### 6. Key Insights & Conclusion  
- Employees doing **OverTime** show higher attrition rates  
- Younger employees (**25–35 years**) are more likely to leave  
- **Job satisfaction** and **environment satisfaction** strongly influence retention  
- Higher **income levels** and longer **tenure** are associated with lower attrition
